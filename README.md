STOUT: SMILES TO IUPAC Translator is built using the same concept as a Neural Machine Translation(NMT). STOUT is initially trained on a subset downloaded from PubChem [1] containing 30 Million SMILES [2] and 60 Million SMILES. which got converted into SELFIES using the SELFIES package. The same set of SMILES also was converted into IUPAC names using ChemAxon "molconvert", a command-line program in Marvin Suite 20.15 from ChemAxon (https://www.chemaxon.com)[3]. Later the textual data was converted into TFRecords(Binary files) for training on Tensor Processing Units(TPUs).

# Summary of the work.

- We currently don‚Äôt have any open-source software to generate IUPAC names for a given molecule. To do that we came up with an idea to use a machine learning model based on the Neural Machine Translation. Our models can translate any given Canonical SMILES to IUPAC name and back.

- We used BLEU scoring [4] for the accuracy calculation.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU
https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/translate/bleu_score.html

- Also we back-translated the IUPAC names to SMILES using OPSIN [5] for further statistical evaluation.

#### OS-Support: Linux, MACOS and Windows (On Windows you can run STOUT inside the Ubuntu shell). But It is highly recommended to use a Linux system.

# Usage

### We suggest to use STOUT inside a Conda environment, which makes the dependencies to install easily.
- Conda can be downloaded as part of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or the [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) plattforms (Python 3.7). We recommend to install miniconda3. Using Linux you can get it with:
```
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
## How to use STOUT

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install default-jdk # Incase if you do not have Java already installed
$ sudo apt install unzip
$ git clone https://github.com/Kohulan/SMILES-to-IUPAC-Translator.git
$ cd SMILES-to-IUPAC-Translator
$ conda create --name STOUT python=3.7.9
$ conda activate STOUT
$ conda install pip
$ python -m pip install -U pip #Upgrade pip
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.3.0 selfies matplotlib unicodedata2 
```
### Install tensorflow==2.3.0 if you do not have an nVidia GPU (On Mac OS)

```
$ pip install tensorflow==2.3.0 selfies matplotlib unicodedata2
$ python STOUT_V_2.1.py --help #Use for help
```
- When you run the program for the first time the models will get automatically downloaded(Note: total size is ~ 3.1GB). Also, you can manually download the models from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/iupac_models_trained/Trained_model/STOUT_trained_models_v2.0.zip)
```
e.g.: 

# Always write the SMILES or IUPAC name inside quotes ''/"".

python STOUT_V_2.1.py --smiles 'CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C' #SMILES to IUPAC
python STOUT_V_2.1.py --iupac '1,3,7-trimethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione' #IUPAC to SMILES
```

## How to use in Windows

- Make sure Ubuntu subsytem is installed in your Windows PC. check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for more details how to get it.
- If you have a Nvidia GPU in your Windows PC please check the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) guidlines, to how to install [TensorFlow GPU](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) in your PC.
- Inside the Ubuntu subsystem you can run STOUT.
